𝗘𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗮𝗹 8 Spring Boot microservice patterns
=====
Design choices that scale systems reliably.

Why this matters.
Spring Boot gives speed, but patterns give resilience and maintainability.

1️** 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝗚𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘄𝗮𝘆**
↳ Use a gateway to centralize routing, auth, and rate limiting.
↳ Spring Cloud Gateway or Kong work well with Spring Boot.
↳ Example. Offload CORS, auth, and request aggregation at the gateway.

 **𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗣𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲**
↳ Each service owns its schema to avoid coupling and hidden transactions.
↳ Prefer eventual consistency and careful data duplication.
↳ Example. Orders service uses Postgres. Inventory uses MongoDB.

**𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿**
↳ Protect services from cascading failures by tripping on errors.
↳ Use Resilience4j for circuit breaker, metrics and recovery hooks.
↳ Example. Fail fast to fallback and restore when downstream recovers.

**𝗕𝘂𝗹𝗸𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗜𝘀𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻**
↳ Limit resources per operation or client to prevent total outage.
↳ Implement threadpool or semaphore bulkheads in Resilience4j.
↳ Example. Isolate heavy report processing from user facing flows.

**𝗥𝗲𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗼𝗳𝗳**
↳ Retry transient failures with exponential backoff and jitter.
↳ Use Spring Retry or Resilience4j retry policies.
↳ Example. Retry on 503 with capped attempts to avoid thundering herd.

**𝗦𝗮𝗴𝗮 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗯𝘂𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀**
↳ Choose orchestration or choreography for long running workflows.
↳ Use lightweight orchestrator or events over Kafka for choreography.
↳ Example. Order placement triggers inventory and billing compensations.

**𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗤𝗥𝗦**
↳ Store events as the source of truth to enable audit and replay.
↳ Combine with CQRS to separate read performance from write logic.
↳ Example. Use Kafka or event store plus read model rebuilt asynchronously.

**𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗲 𝗔𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗽𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆**
↳ Use cache aside with Redis or Caffeine to reduce latency and load.
↳ Ensure idempotent endpoints to make retries safe.
↳ Example. Cache product details and make payment API idempotent.
